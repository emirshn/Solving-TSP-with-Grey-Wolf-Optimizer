# Solving-TSP-with-Grey-Wolf-Optimizer
I attempted to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) efficiently using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). While GWO was originally designed for continuous optimization problems, I adapted it for discrete problems such as TSP by implementing the I-GWO algorithm.

The implementation is highly customizable, allowing users to modify parameters such as the number of solutions, the number of iterations, and more.

This code can automatically detect any TSP file with a .tsp extension and, if an optimal tour file with a .opt extension is present, it can compare the computed solution against the optimal one.

For example, the comparison for some problems look like these:
